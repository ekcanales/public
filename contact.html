                          As a former collegiate athlete, Jenner knows the importance of embracing both physical and mental elements of fitness. Since encountering Foundation Training in 2012, Jenner has experienced positive changes to her swimming stroke, posture, and overall well-being. Throughout her athletic career, she utilized Foundation Training as a tool in injury prevention and recovery. Today, Jennerâ€™s practice continues to play an integral role in her daily life, as she finds it to be the most effective tool in grounding her body and focusing her mind. More specifically, the decompression breathing component of the practice has transformed her mental health, and she is forever grateful for the deep and lasting impacts of this work.

                          Linda Guanti is a Certified Level 2 Foundation Training Instructor, FRC Mobility Specialist, Certified Yoga Instructor, Medical Imaging Technologist, and Steward of Horses. Her journey into health care began with her own journey of healing from spinal fractures she incurred in her teens, the absence of rehabilitation, and the subsequent disc injuries afterward. The mainstream medical system's method of medication and potential surgery did not resonate with her, and she spent many years exploring different 'alternative' methods which offered some relief but left her limited and in pain. It wasn't until she found Foundation Training that her life truly turned around. She recognized its benefits almost immediately and went to one of the first Certification Trainings in 2013. After FT, she finally felt able to try new sports, be as active as she had dreamed, go through pregnancy, and have a child (now 7 years old). Linda believes that the human body is far more powerful and adaptive than you can imagine. Drawing on over 25 years of Health Care and teaching experience, she is passionate about sharing with others this invaluable information on what and why imbalances may be occurring in your body and these accessible tools that are for 'every body'.

        <h2 class="title is-4">Our Story, The Legacy of Mona Melms</h2>
                <p>True Line Fitness was founded with the goal of promoting holistic fitness through Foundation Training. Our mission is to help individuals achieve better posture, movement, and overall well-being.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="is-size-7">Mona Melms, RN, brought Foundation Training to the Madison area in 2012. Mona was a warrior, a bright light and a leader in fitness. She was a wife, mother of young children and a highly respected nurse when cancer first struck her. From that time on she added personal fitness to her many causes. Recognizing that life takes strength, purpose and risk, she opened her first studio, Melt Studio, where she taught group fitness classes and offered one-on-one personal training.
<br><br>In 2012, Mona attended the first ever Foundation Training instructor certification program, where she befriended Dr. Eric Goodman. Impressed with Foundation Training Method, Mona immediately began teaching it to others. She later opened a second studio, The Mona Method Studio, to better accommodate her growing group classes. It was in the studio setting that Jenner and Suzanne first encountered this beautiful powerhouse of a woman, and were drawn by her enthusiasm to Foundation Training.
<br><br>Forever the encourager and collaborator, Mona gave Jenner and Suzanne opportunities to teach right alongside her. Cancer struck Mona a second time in 2017, and then again in 2020. For three decades she'd fought the good fight. With great dignity she encouraged her fellow instructors to keep going.
<br><br>In 2019, Mona and Suzanne had met Linda Guanti while attending the Level 2 Foundation Training certification in Boulder, Colorado. Just weeks before she died, Mona achieved her Level 2 certification.
<br><br>As part of Mona's enduring legacy, and especially in appreciation of her collaborative spirit, Jenner, Linda and Suzanne have joined together to keep each other sharp and to bring you high quality Foundation Training instruction. 
<br><br><b>Keep shining, Mona! </b></p>
